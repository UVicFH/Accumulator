# Accumulator2018

This repository is for the 2017-2018 accumulator and AMS. It will be based on the design from last season and for the most part will use the same components. The main (proposed) change is to move the controller onto the same board as the first cell monitor in the daisy chain and have them communicate using SPI instead of isoSPI. The 3 cell monitors will still communicate with each other using isoSPI. We also plan to make a PCB to control the charging and discharging, but this is lower priority.

For all non-code files (Google Docs, Altium files, etc.) relating to the accumulator and AMS, see the team Google Drive under Electrical/2017-2018/Accumulator.
